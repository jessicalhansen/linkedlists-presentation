# Linked List

## Introduction

In Computer Science, a linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object.
Linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location, meaning they are not adjacent to each other; the elements are linked using pointers. The key component of a linked list is a **node**. Each node of a list is made up of two items:
* A [Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)) property that stores a value.
* A [Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_(computer_science)) (in other words, a *link*) to the **next** node. This property can also be called the **Next** property, sometimes called a "pointer" that points to the next item in the list. <br> 

The last node has a reference to null. The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list. It should be noted that head is not a separate node, but the reference to the first node. If the list is empty then the head is a null reference. In the case of linked lists, the only exception to this rule is the very last node. It doesn’t need a pointer, so it’s known as a “null next node” (or more simply, “the tail”). <br>

### How a node stores data:

Linked lists start with a **head node** and grow by using pointers to other nodes in different parts of the computer's memory. Nodes allow the linked list to expand fairly easily, but requires more space than an array due to storing both the data and the pointers. There is no index value in linked lists, so in order to access data from a particular node you must start with the head node and move through the list sequentially. This can result in a lengthy timeline to access data in a linked list because the data set isn't read in one continuous chunk. 

***Doubly Linked Lists*** are exactly the same as **singly linked lists** and first point to the next node in one direction, but also points back to the previous node.

#### At least two examples of the assigned topic:
 1. Trains (Singly) - Train cars are linked in a specific order so that they may be loaded, unloaded, transferred, dropped off, and picked up in the most efficient manner possible. The train travels only forward and the last train car has no connections.

 2. Spotify (Doubly) - Each song points to both the previous and next songs.

#### Identify situations where you use a linked list instead of an array.
 1. When you need constant-time insertions/deletions from the list (such as in real-time computing where time predictability is absolutely critical)
 2. Not sure how many items will be in the list
 3. If you do not need random access to any elements
 4. If you'll want to be able to insert items in the middle of the list
